## Web applications

When asked to create a web application, always create a single page app with vite and preact, starting from the preact-ts template.
Always use tailwindcss for design and mantine for components.
Always use our own preact-router from this repo for routing.
Always make sure that the webapp compiles.
Always use the following "dev" script in package.json
```
"dev": "vite --strictPort --port 4000 --host",
```
